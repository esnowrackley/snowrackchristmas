            <p>Merry Christmas, Mom & Dad!</p> 
            <p>On this website, you'll find a few pairings: a special place, a restaurant, and a place to get drinks. These are places that I think are special or in some way worth visiting before moving away.</p>
            <p>The gift is: whenever you want to, pick one of these for a date night (or few! You don't have to do all the activities in one night, they just go well together). Let me know when you do and I'll call, make the reservations, and pick up the tab; Cleveland on me! If you want I'll look at the menu and give my reccomendations for drinks.</p>
            <p>This is something you can do just you two, as a family, however you like. Consider this the master gift card.</p> 
            <p>You might not find a lot of new spots in here, but there might be a novel place or two. Cleveland's still changing after all these years... eat up!</p>

The metroparks didn't have this when we were younger, but I remember many a Saturday on the other side of the bridge heading down to the Ohio City Bike Co-op. It's not as nice over there, but here, take a pause and take in the overlook. It's a precious sight. Best experienced in later spring.</p>

He ordered for us and quizzed us on the different flavors we found in each drink. They were truly amazing. If you're looking for a little more low-key, we can sub in the Literary Tavern, they've also got pierogis.</p>
